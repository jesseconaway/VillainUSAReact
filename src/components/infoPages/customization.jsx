      <h1>Customization</h1>
      <p>We offer custom printing on nearly all of the products we offer!</p>
      <p>
        This means that you can have custom equipment that's 100% unique to you.
        If you're ordering for your gym, we can print your gym's name and/or
        logo on nearly any equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pricing on custom orders will vary based on the type and extent of
        customization, and time-to-ship will increase due to custom production,
        but there's really nothing like opening up a shipment of equipment
        that's 100% your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a no-obligation estimate on custom equipment, contact us with a
        message including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Product to be customized</li>
        <li>An estimate of how many pieces</li>
        <li>Desired custom elements (gym name, logo, color, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
