        The easiest way to place an order is through our secure checkout system
        powered by Snipcart and Paypal.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you'd like custom printing on an order, or if you're
        ordering a customized product like our complete training rack, the
        ordering process will start with filling out our contact form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of how you order, payment will be processed securely through
        Paypal (with no additional processing fees), and your order will ship on
        the coming Saturday. If you have any questions about ordering, payment,
        shipping, or products, please contact us through our easy contact form!
